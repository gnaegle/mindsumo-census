Solution to Capital One's "Use population data to identify promising markets" challenge on MindSumo, which can be viewed [here](). Unfortunately, I did not win or get recognized.

Usage
------
python parseCensus.py [File name of CSV file]

When no file argument is given, it looks for a file called "Metropolitan_Populations__2010-2012_.csv". If a file is passed into the script, then it needs to be in the same format as the Metropolitan_Populations__2010-2012_.csv file in this repository.
